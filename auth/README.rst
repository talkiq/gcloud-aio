Auth Helpers for Asyncio Google Cloud Library
=============================================

This library is not meant to be a standalone project, rather it is used by
various ``gcloud-aio-*`` packages.

This library implements a ``Token`` class, which is used for authorizing
against Google Cloud. The other ``gcloud-aio-*`` package components accept a
``Token`` instance as an argument; you can define a single token for all of
these components or define one for each. Each component corresponds to a given
Google Cloud service and each service requires "`scopes`_".
