    This is often trivial: convert the value from a string to the type

    so far, though:

    * NULLABLE fields should be handled specially, eg. so as not to
      accidentally convert them to the schema type.
    * REPEATED fields are nested a biot differently than expected, so we need
      to flatten *first*, then convert.

    represent in a backwards-enough compatible fashion.
